'm an experienced programmer and data scientist with a passion for using technology to solve complex problems. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in machine learning, web development, and data analysis, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

This GitHub repository is a showcase of my work and experiences, featuring a variety of projects that demonstrate my technical proficiency and creativity. I believe that the best way to learn and grow as a programmer is to take on projects that push me out of my comfort zone, and I'm always looking for new ways to expand my skillset and knowledge.

I'm proud of the work I've done on these projects, and I'm always looking for new ways to use technology to make a positive impact in the world.

Skills I have a diverse range of skills and expertise, including:

Machine learning: I'm experienced in building and training models for a variety of applications, from predicting stock prices to identifying fraudulent transactions.
Data analysis: I'm skilled in using Python and R to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data, and I have experience working with large datasets and building statistical models. Contact
If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to get in touch, please feel free to email me at orbenson@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunities and love to hear from fellow programmers and data scientists
